JabberBot

A robot for jabber servers.  Current incarnation scans a directory looking
and joins chatrooms (one per subdirectory).  To enter a password protected
room you should create a file in the main directory called $ROOMNAME.passwd
in that file you should place the room password.

/tmp/rooms
/tmp/rooms/servicechat -- join the servicechat room

/tmp/rooms/webadmin.passwd -- password for the webadmin room
/tmp/rooms/webadmin

Jabberbot will then scan the subdirectories for files.  When a new file appears
it will write the contents to the room and delete the file.
